			<div id="centercolumn">
				<p>Each year, approximately 100 children in the Geelong area experience the death of a parent. Currently, no specialist service exists that offer professional support to these children. This is an extremely difficult time for them and their family, and this can potentially result in long-term emotional health problems.</p>
				
				<p>We assist bereaved children to find a way to live with loss and grief, to move forward and take the next steps on their bereavement journey.</p>

				<p>Wombat's Wish is based on a very successful and highly regarded <i>Winston's Wish</i> program in the UK. Wombat's Wish hopes to demonstrate the value of such a service in the Geelong area.</p>

				<p>The service is a therapeutic one, provided by a team of professional facilitators in conjunction with trained volunteers.</p>

				<p>At Wombat's Wish we believe all bereaved children, young people and their parents/carers have the right to information, guidance and support to enable them to manage the impact of death on their lives.</p>

				<p>See the <a href="{$base_url}/volunteer">volunteer</a> for information about volunteering for Wombat's Wish.</p>
