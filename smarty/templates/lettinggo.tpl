		<p>Wombat's Wish is a not-for-profit organisation which assists children who are grieving the death of a parent or significant person. This is an extremely difficult time for them and their family, and the resulting trauma can potentially result in long-term emotional health problems if not addressed. </p>

		<p>Wombat's Wish is holding an annual short-story writing competition entitled "Letting Go". This competition provides an opportunity for young people grieving the death of someone special, to express their personal experiences in an open and creative manner. Through the power of words, participants can begin to 'let go' of grief, celebrate the life of someone they loved, and look to the future as they continue their own lives in positive mental health. The competition is inclusive of primary and secondary school ages, with four prize categories:</p>

		<ul>
			<li><b>Primary aged</b> - 1st prize and 2nd prize</li>
			<li><b>Secondary aged</b> - 1st prize and 2nd prize</li>
		</ul>

		<p><b><i>We humbly invite you to support our event, by donating some prizes which can be used for our winning entries. </i></b></p>

		<p>If you would like to donate we would love to hear from you. Any donations, large or small, would be greatly appreciated!</p>

		<p>We thank you in anticipation, and look forward to the opportunity of working with you.</p>
