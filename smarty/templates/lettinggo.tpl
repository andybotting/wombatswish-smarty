		<h4>Judge's Comments</h4>
		<p>Congratulations to all entrants for the honest and sensitive way in which they explored the topic Letting Go.</p>
		<p>In the <u>Primary Section</u>, <b>Ebony's</b> piece about her cousin shows maturity, and I especially enjoyed the way in which she did not reveal the subject of the story until near the end.</p>
		<p><b>Shaun</b> writes fluently and clearly about the relationship he enjoyed with his father, and he reflects on that loss now and into the future.</p>
		<p>In the <u>Secondary Section</u>, <b>Elle's</b> sensitive and thoughtful approach to the loss of a loved teacher is a powerful and touching piece. She uses childlike language structure but infuses it with a maturity beyond her years.</p>
		<p><b>Chloe's</b> use of interchanging narratives work very well and the writing is fluent. The use of remembered conversation creates an interesting structure.</p>
		<p><b>Pep's</b> story explores memory loss, the grief associated with dementia and its impact on those around. A fluent and well-structured piece.</p>
